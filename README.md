The idea revolves around employing reinforcement learning to develop an AI capable of altering style and generated images based on user feedback and preferences.

## Plan
1. Prepare dataset with metadata
2. Data preprocessing
3. Creating a learning environment
4. Agent training
5. Testing and optimization
6. Project implementation
